# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio, where I showcase my work on past projects.

The projects all deal with exploring datasets and developing machine learning models, using Jupyter Notebooks and Python. The following major Data Science and Machine Learning Python libraries are used:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* keras
* tensorflow

In the sections that follow, a brief description of the contents of each folder in this repository will be given, to help the reader navigate to whatever projects may be of interest.

## Bank Marketing

Jupyter Notebook containing code to develop a machine learning model to predict the success of a bank marketing campaign.

## Boston Housing Regression

Jupyter Notebook containing code to develop a machine learning model to predict the price of a home. Along with the Iris dataset (see below) the Boston Housing dataset is a very popular machine learning project for "beginners."

## Deep Learning

### Cats vs Dogs

Jupyter Notebook showing the development of a Cats vs. Dogs image classifier model using deep learning, image augmentation, and pretrained convolutional neural networks.

### Kaggle Digit Recognizer

Jupyter Notebook showing my work for the Kaggle Digit Recognizer Competition, which is a machine learning competition to experiment with models for computer vision.

### Kaggle NLP Disaster Tweets

Jupyter Notebook showing the process of developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to predict whether tweets are about real natural disasters or not.

### Temperature Prediction

Jupyter Notebook showing the development of a time series temperature prediction model.

## Kaggle Breast Cancer

Jupyter Notebook showing the development of a machine learning model that can aid in the diagnosis of breast cancer.

## Kaggle Heart Disease

Jupyter Notebook showing the development of a machine learning model that can predict if a patient has heart disease.

## Kaggle House Prices

Jupyter Notebook showing the development of a machine learning model that predicts the sale prices of houses.

## Kaggle Iris

Jupyter Notebook showing the development of a machine learning model that can predict the species of an Iris flower.

## Kaggle Titanic

Jupyter Notebook showing the development of a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger aboard the Titanic would have survived the disaster or not.
